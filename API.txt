Everything parameters would be an ASCI string.

Entry points would be URLs with data provided via post.

POST to http://localhost/submit:

    db_name (any string)
    multi_hits (true or false)
    hmmer3_compat (true or false)
    data_format (fasta)
    data (content of a fasta file)

I would parse the data using `fasta-reader`, write the sequences
using `fasta-reader` into a buffer (so we eliminate characters data
that don't matter to the query). Compute the xxh3 64-bits hash
of all the above (let it be `job_id`).

begin_transaction();
INSERT into job VALUES (job_id, db_name, ...);
for seq_name, seq in DATA:
    INSERT into seq VALUES (job_id, seq_name0, seq0);
end_transaction();

Return to the user a JSON response:

    response: ok
    job_id: `job_id`
